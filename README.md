# circle-play
Fun Python widget to digitize circles on a grid


Hello friends,
This widget is a good introduction to making tcl/tk type widgets in Python.

The widget initializes with a grid of points, allowing you to draw a circle/ellipse as you wish on the screen. As soon as you finish drawing your circle/ellipse, it highlights the points on the grid closest to the boundary of the circle/ellipse you just drew.

There are a couple of other bells and whistles too. Look at the .ipynb file. 


Enjoy!
